# MM_SoilVeg

This is an R project which includes the analysis steps for Chapter 5 of my PhD thesis. Scripts are currently up to date but may need some tweaking. Please email stefanie.bonat@sydney.edu.au for more information about data files. Data is not publicly available as these chapters are under revision, but will be made available after publication.

If you would like to use these, set up an R project with the following folder structure:

data
figures (with two subfolders named: soil, veg. These have two subfolders each named: exploratory_plots, models)
results (with two subfolders named: soil, veg)
scripts

Place the R project in the main folder. Scripts are ordered by number following the steps undertaken during the analysis.
